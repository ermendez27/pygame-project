
This is my pygame demo, a simple 2d platformer demo made completely in Python!
it uses the pygame module, which i think you need to install in order to run this

to do that, feed this to your command line terminal (assuming you already have python installed):

pip install pygame


after that, run the main file and you should be good to go!
move and jump using arrow keys (you can double jump 2)

the background and flooring are sprites I found online, but the caption and character animations I designed all on my own using a program called Asesprite :)

This project taught me a lot, from sprite sheet splicing, dynamic image loading, collision detection, physics emulation and so much more.
Hope ya like it
